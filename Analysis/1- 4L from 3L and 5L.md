# Measure 4 L Water using 3L and 5L Jars

1. Fill the 5L jar to the top.
2. Pour water from the 5L jar into the 3L jar until it's full, leaving you with 2 liters in the 5L jar.
3. Empty the 3L jar.
4. Pour the 2 liters from the 5L jar into the 3L jar.
5. Fill the 5L jar to the top again.
6. Carefully pour water from the 5L jar into the 3L jar until it's full. Since there are already 2 liters in the 3L jar, you can only add 1 more liter, leaving you with exactly 4 liters in the 5L jar.

Now, you have 4 liters of water in the 5L jar.
