# Static Variable and Method

In object-oriented programming, a static variable and a static method are associated with a class rather than with instances (objects) of the class. Here's an explanation of both concepts:

### Static Variable:
 - A static variable is a class-level variable that is shared among all instances (objects) of the class.
 - It is declared using the `static` keyword in the class.
 - Unlike instance variables, which have separate copies for each object, a static variable has only one copy that is shared by all instances.
 - Static variables are often used to represent data that is common to all instances of a class.

Example in Java:

```java
public class ExampleClass {
    // Static variable
    public static int staticVariable = 0;

    // Rest of the class...
}
```

Accessing the static variable:

```java
int value = ExampleClass.staticVariable;
```

### Static Method:

- A static method is a method that belongs to the class rather than an instance of the class.
- It is also declared using the `static` keyword in the method signature.
- Static methods cannot access instance-specific variables directly, as they are not tied to a particular object's state.
- They are often used for utility functions that do not require access to instance-specific data.

Example in Java:

```java
public class ExampleClass {
    // Static method
    public static void staticMethod() {
        System.out.println("This is a static method.");
    }
}
```

Calling the static method:

```java
ExampleClass.staticMethod();
```

Usage of static variables and methods can provide benefits in certain scenarios, such as when you want to maintain common data or behavior across all instances of a class without duplicating it for each object. However, it's important to use them judiciously, as they can also lead to issues like tight coupling and difficulties in testing and maintenance.

|--------------------|----------------------------------------------------------------------|---------------------------------------------------------------------|
| **Static Variable** | Shared by all instances of the class. Accessed via `ClassName.variable`. | Shared by all instances. Defined outside the class: `ClassName::variable`. |
| **Static Method**   | Belongs to the class. Called without creating an object using `ClassName.method()`. | Belongs to the class. Called without creating an object using `ClassName::method()`. |
